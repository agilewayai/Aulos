# Retrospective Snapshot

Generated at: `2026-07-25T19:31:05+00:00`

## Recent changes

- REVIEW-008 smoke `423-287-1`: was truncating to release 423; now catno search → Mozart/Horowitz
- Fixes: parse catno, Discogs search, exclude composer from performers, workish titles
- Verify: `test_discogs.py` 6 passed; live `resolve_discogs_message("/discogs #423-287-1")` SMOKE_OK
- Root cause of “no Discogs token UI”: local-only; live OPS/API not redeployed
- Deployed host: OPS nav **Discogs** tab + `/v1/ops/discogs` (401 without auth = route live)
- OPS GUI: dedicated **Integrations** tab for Discogs token (status + enable + save/clear); Overview link

## What is working

- REVIEW-008 smoke `423-287-1`: was truncating to release 423; now catno search → Mozart/Horowitz
- Fixes: parse catno, Discogs search, exclude composer from performers, workish titles
- Verify: `test_discogs.py` 6 passed; live `resolve_discogs_message("/discogs #423-287-1")` SMOKE_OK
- Root cause of “no Discogs token UI”: local-only; live OPS/API not redeployed

## What needs attention

- working tree is dirty with 56 tracked or untracked change(s)
- no explicit next-up slice is recorded

## Durable reminders

- Source of truth: `git@github.com:agilewayai/aries-harness-skills.git` (not `AriesHarnessStudio` / `aries-studio`).
- Local reference clone: `/home/ubuntu/studio/aries-harness-skills` (keep in sync with origin).
- 导赏 is Agent tool-chain (`run_listening_skill`), not API `iter_listening_chain`.
- See aulos-agent ARCH-002 / ADR-003 / SPEC-002.
- Store/API: UTC ISO with ``Z``. Display (web/ops): OS/browser timezone via ``src/time.ts`` ``formatDateTime`` / ``formatTime``.
- Harness scripts/templates: `.aries_harness/scripts/` + `.aries_harness/templates/` (not project-root `scripts/`/`templates/`).

## Promotion rule

- if a lesson is durable, move it into MEMORY, docs/insights, AGENTS, or a reusable harness asset
- do not let retrospective output become the only place where important operating knowledge lives
