# Daily Summary Index

Generated at: `2026-07-27T09:44:43+00:00`

This index tracks the generated daily development summaries under `history/daily/`.

## Daily reports

- `2026-07-27` -> `daily/2026-07-27.md`
- `2026-07-26` -> `daily/2026-07-26.md`
- `2026-07-25` -> `daily/2026-07-25.md`

## Design rule

- daily summaries are generated projections of journal and git evidence, not manually maintained source truth
- if the daily memo is weak, improve `JOURNAL.md`, `STATE.md`, `TASK_STACK.md`, or commit hygiene rather than editing generated files by hand
